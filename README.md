# Mentor Markets Roadmap



## Why?

Learning any skill on your own is hard. Look at any successful person- most of them will say they had a "mentor", an expert in that skill


## High Level TODOs

### Frontend

- Scaffold a React project


- Create the different pages of the app:


- Put hardcoded text in various pages


- Add buttons / links to other pages, inputs, etc


- Styling, make it look nice / responsive / accesibility


- Auth


- Call out to backend allowing users to view / sign up for / create events (as a "mentor" and/or as a "mentee").


- WebRTC piece for video / audio / screenshare calls during the actual meetings


- Counter recording exact amount of time the meeting lasts


- Traditional payment processor integration (secure credit card, paypal, apple pay, etc...)


- Crypto payment processor integration (ethereum mainnet, polygon, solana, etc...). escrow?


- Onboarding & Marketing materials


- Map view to find nearby mentors 


### Backend


- Set up database (postgres? mongo?)


- Auth


- Lambda functions for auth-based CRUD with db


- Signalling server for the video calls


- payment processing
